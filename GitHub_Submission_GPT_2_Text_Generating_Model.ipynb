And in accordance with what you have termed their constitutions; if they were not, they were a second democracy, then there will be two again; and in such a case a third or a fourth is to be the principal, unless they have already established a third and the fifth to be the principal or the first for such a second democracy?\n",

I mean, for example, in a democracy the principle which is to govern the government is not the absolute, but is a principle on which the rulers govern and are to rule and not be governed --I ask you, are you not saying; as for a democracy to consist of a number of constitutions is to consist of two or more constitutions, the first being the last and the second the first?
